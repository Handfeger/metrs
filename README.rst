MET Remote Sensing
==================

Project work for Remote Sensing of the Meteorology Master at the Universit of Cologne

Installation
============
For ease of setup we use the environment handling of conda and package resolving of poetry. To install you will need `conda` or `miniconda`.

**All of this will most likely only work on macos**

.. code-block:: bash
    cd path/to/folder
    conda env create -f ./environment.yml
    conda activate metfut
    poetry install
